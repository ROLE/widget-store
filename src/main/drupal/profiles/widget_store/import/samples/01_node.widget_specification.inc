For representing his company in the international market he has to attend the Book Fair in London.&nbsp;As business communication here is in English, Tim needs to improve his English skills, especially in business English. He has been learning already for other purposes with his Personal Learning Environment (PLE) and now wants to use it to learn English.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>Tim opens a web browser window displaying his Personal Learning Environment. He adds new learning applications (widgets) which he wants to use for learning Business English. Among others, he adds the Vocabulary Trainer Widget where he can build up the vocabulary that he wants to learn regularly and logs in.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>Tim starts reading a new text about the book fair in London. But he doesn’t know the word “negotiation”, so he wants to add it to a personal vocabulary list. He switches to the Vocabulary Widget and creates a new vocabulary list, named “bookfair”. Now he can add the selected term to his list.Tim continues to read the next article about ‘Comic books which are used for education’. During reading he adds several terms to his list, also the term ‘exploitation gap’. But he doesn’t find the suggested translation of the term succeeded. So Tim types in a custom translation of the term in his list.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>After some reading and entering of words, Tim has a good list of vocabulary items out of his area of expertise.Now Tim wants to train the newly learned words in his vocabulary list using the Vocabulary Trainer widget. The widget gives him an English word and prompts for his translation to German. Analysing his answer, it indicates whether it is correct or wrong. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>One day, he is learning with his vocabulary trainer and recognizes that he has problems to remember the term ‘lack of access’ because he does not know the context anymore. Fortunately, the vocabulary trainer has stored the link to the original text.&nbsp;Tim clicks on the source-function and the original text appears in a new tab.&nbsp;Reading the sentence and thinking of the context facilitates him to memorize the term.&nbsp;Another benefit is that Tim now knows in which situations he can use the term.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>After a few weeks in which Tim has continuously worked with the Language Learning Widgets, he takes a look at the learning statistics in the vocabulary trainer. He sees the success rate of 100%, which makes him feel well prepared for his new job.</span></p>',
