This Shindig source code has been modified to work on the ROLE server.
Th ROLE server has some difficulties, with the newer 2.5beta version, 
which not occured in Shindig 2.0. Most probable these "bugs" were induced by 
the use of PHP 5.3.3. On the local development maschine running PHP 5.3.8 none 
of these behaviors occured.

Further modifications have been made to add opensocial features or re-add opensocial features.
