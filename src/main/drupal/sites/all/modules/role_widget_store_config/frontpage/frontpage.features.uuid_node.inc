ROLE technology is centred around the concept of Self-regulated learning that creates responsible and thinking learners that are able to plan their learning process, search for the resources independently, learn and then reflect on their learning process and progress. Given this task, ROLE´s main objective is to support teachers in developing the open personal learning environments for their students where they can train each of the phases mentioned. ROLE has just entered the fourth project year, where our main endeavour is to test the already operating learning environment and widgets. You are invited to follow us on facebook, twitter, linkedin or youtube.</p><h1>Would you like to Join ROLE?</h1><p>The ROLE Alliance Programme offers additional synergy opportunities for all those, who would like to test, enhance or further exploit our open source results.
